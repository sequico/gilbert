 * Where the app is mounted. Unlike everything else ihasmail is told, this one
 * cannot wait until the process starts: the hashed asset URLs are written into
 * index.html when the bundle is built, so a build that does not know its prefix
 * emits `/assets/...` and the shell 404s under `/mail/`. So `BASE_PATH` is read
 * at build time here as well as at run time in the server, and the Dockerfile
 * carries one value into both.
 *
 * Vite wants the directory form with the trailing slash, and hands it back to
 * the app as `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` -- which is where `lib/basePath.ts`
 * gets it, so the browser never has to be told separately.
