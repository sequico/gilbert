/**
 * Where a message goes when it is archived by date.
 *
 * The folders are **numeric and zero-padded** -- `Archive/2026`,
 * `Archive/2026/09` -- and deliberately not month names. Two reasons, both
 * about the fact that these are real server-side mailboxes rather than
 * anything of Gilbert's:
 *
 *  - Every other client sees them. A folder created as "September" by someone
 *    reading in English stays "September" for the same account read in
 *    Japanese, because the name is stored, not translated. A number reads the
 *    same in every language Gilbert ships.
 *  - They sort. `09` sits between `08` and `10` in any folder list; "September"
 *    sits between "October" and nothing useful.
 *
 * The date is read in the reader's own timezone rather than UTC, because it has
 * to agree with the date shown against the message in the list. A message that
 * arrived at 00:30 UTC on 1 September is dated 31 August in New York, and
 * filing it under `09` while the list says August would be the app disagreeing
 * with itself.
