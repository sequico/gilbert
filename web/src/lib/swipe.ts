/**
 * What a swipe on a message row does, and what it should say it is about to do.
 *
 * The reader picks one action for each direction in Settings, but an action is
 * not a fixed thing: "delete" out of Deleted Items is permanent, "report spam"
 * inside Junk Mail is the opposite request, and "archive" while looking at the
 * archive is nothing at all. The strip revealed behind the row has to name the
 * thing that will actually happen, in the folder it is happening in -- a row
 * that slides open to reveal the word "Archive" and then does nothing is worse
 * than one that does not slide.
 *
 * So a direction with no meaning here resolves to `null`, and a null direction
 * is one the row simply will not move in.
