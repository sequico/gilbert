/**
 * What, if anything, we can show of a file without downloading it.
 *
 * Two questions, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *  - `previewKind` — can the app render it in a dialog? Text is answered with
 *    `fetch`, which ignores Content-Disposition, so this is free to say yes to
 *    anything text-shaped.
 *  - `openableInTab` — will the *server* hand it back inline? That mirrors
 *    `isInlineSafe` in `server/src/app.ts`, which is the security boundary:
 *    everything else is served as an attachment with a sandbox CSP. Navigating
 *    to a blob the server will not inline just starts a download, so the
 *    "open in a new tab" affordance has to ask this and not the other one.
 *
 * Keep the two in step by hand. They answer different questions and neither
 * can be derived from the other.
