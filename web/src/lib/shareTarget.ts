 * is the tab picking it up. See the note on `stashShare` in sw.js for why the
 * worker answers that request rather than the app or the server.
 *
 * The handoff goes through the cache rather than postMessage because a share
 * usually launches the app: there is no tab to message at the moment it
 * arrives, and the one that appears a second later is a different context that
 * has to find the payload lying somewhere.

 * Gilbert lands on the sign-in page, and the composer can only open once
 * there is an account to open it in. Waiting for that means the payload has to
 * outlive a redirect and a login, which the query string does not.
 *
 * What that costs is the possibility of a stash nobody ever came back for, so
 * it expires. Ten minutes is long enough for signing in -- password manager,
 * app password, a second device -- and short enough that a share abandoned
 * this morning does not open a composer full of a forgotten photo tonight.
