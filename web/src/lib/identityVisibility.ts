/**
 * Which identities the compose picker offers.
 *
 * Someone using a unique address per service, on a server with an alias domain,
 * ends up with every local part twice and a picker they cannot use — while only
 * ever sending from a handful (#73). Hiding is presentation only: the identity
 * still exists, still receives, and is still listed in Settings, the same way an
 * unsubscribed folder is still a folder.
 *
 * Three things it will not do, because a sender picker that cannot offer a
 * sender is worse than a cluttered one:
 *
 *   - hide the identity a draft is already using, which would leave the select
 *     with no matching option and reset the From line under the writer
 *   - hide the default identity, which is what a new draft starts on
 *   - hide everything; if every identity is hidden it shows them all instead
