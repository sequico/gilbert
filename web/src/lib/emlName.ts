/**
 * A filename for a message saved or attached as `.eml`.
 *
 * The rule this replaces was `subject.replace(/[^\w.-]+/g, "_")`, and `\w`
 * without the `u` flag is ASCII: every character of a Russian, Japanese or
 * Chinese subject failed the class, so those messages downloaded as a row of
 * underscores. ihasmail ships in nine languages besides English, so the
 * subjects it handled worst were most of the world's.
 *
 * What is actually unsafe in a filename is a much shorter list than "not
 * ASCII": the path separators, the characters Windows reserves, and the
 * control range. Everything else is a letter to somebody.
 *
 * The test is written by code point rather than as a character class because
 * the escaping in one of those is its own small trap, and this says plainly
 * what it means.
