/**
 * What order the message list is in, expressed as a JMAP sort.

 * The ordering is done by the **server**, over the whole folder, for the same
 * reason search is: a list sorted in the browser is only sorted as far as the
 * browser has loaded, which on a folder of ten thousand is the first fifty and
 * a lie about the rest.
 *
 * That has a cost worth stating. `hasKeyword` is an optional sort property in
 * RFC 8621, so a server may refuse "unread first" outright — and a refusal
 * fails the whole query rather than degrading it. `isSupportedSort` and the
 * fallback in the store exist for that, because a mailbox that will not open
 * is a worse outcome than one in the wrong order.
