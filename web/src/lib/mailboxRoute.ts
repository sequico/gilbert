 * Whether the folder in the address is one this account does not have.
 *
 * Rendering it as an empty folder is the bug (#111): "Nothing here. This
 * folder is empty" is a claim about a folder that is not there, so a stale link
 * reads as a folder that has emptied itself rather than one that is gone.
 *
 * The condition that matters is `loaded`. The folder list arrives after the
 * first paint, so for a moment every id is unknown -- including the right one.
 * Without that gate this answers true on every cold load and sends the reader
 * to their inbox from the folder they asked for, which is a worse bug than the
 * one it fixes and would look exactly like a flaky link.
