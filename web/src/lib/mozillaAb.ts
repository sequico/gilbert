 * Mozilla's LDAP address book schema, turned into a contact card.

 * LDIF is only a syntax: it says how to write `name: value` and nothing about
 * what any name means, so an address book in it is only readable against a
 * schema. There are as many schemas as there are directories, and this handles
 * one -- [Mozilla's][1], which Thunderbird, SOGo and most things that export
 * "an address book as LDIF" write, and which issue #174 asks for by name.
 * Attributes outside it are left where they are rather than guessed at.
