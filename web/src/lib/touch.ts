 * and dragged into a folder. None of those exist on a phone, which instead has
 * three conventions so settled that their absence reads as the app being
 * broken -- swipe a row to act on it, hold a row to select it, and pull the
 * top of a list to refresh it.
 *
 * The numbers and the decisions live here rather than in the components so
 * they can be tested without a touchscreen, and so the three gestures agree
 * with each other: the same slop that says "this finger is holding still"
 * decides whether a long press survives, and the same axis lock keeps a swipe
 * from stealing a scroll.
 *
 * Everything here is touch-only by design. A mouse keeps drag-to-folder, which
 * shares the same pointer stream and would otherwise be fighting a swipe for
 * every drag.
