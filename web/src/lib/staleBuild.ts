/**
 * Reload the page when the server is serving a build this one did not come
 * from.
 *
 * Signing out and picking up a new version are separate things, and only the
 * first happens on its own. An immutable instance holds sessions in memory, so
 * a deploy signs everyone out -- but the tab that was open still has the old
 * bundle in it, and a 401 only swaps the view to the sign-in form. The old
 * JavaScript would go on talking to the new server until someone happened to
 * reload by hand.
 *
 * `index.html` is served `no-cache` and the assets under it are content-hashed
 * and immutable, so a reload is all it takes; the only missing part was
 * something to ask for one. Comparing versions rather than reloading on every
 * 401 means an ordinary session expiry still lands on the sign-in form with the
 * page intact -- only a build that actually moved costs the page.
 *
 * The reload is unconditional once the versions differ. A compose window can
 * be holding text that never reached the server, and after a deploy it cannot
 * be saved either, since the session went with the container -- so this will
 * sometimes take an unsent draft with it. That is a deliberate trade: a tab
 * running code the server no longer speaks is the worse failure, and one that
 * stays behind because someone left a draft open is not automatic at all.

 *
 * The obvious signal turned out to be the wrong one. A deploy kills the
 * EventSource behind `/api/events`, which looks like the perfect cue -- except
 * it arrives while the container is still being replaced, so the check that
 * follows cannot reach the server. Waiting for the stream to come back instead
 * does not work either: the session died with the old container, so the
 * reconnect is answered with a 401 and never reaches "connected" at all. The
 * drop is kept below because it is free and sometimes lands early enough to be
 * useful, but nothing depends on it.
 *
 * What the guarantee rests on is a slow poll while the tab is visible, plus a
 * check when it becomes visible again. Neither cares what the stream is doing
 * or whether anyone is at the keyboard: a tab left open through a deploy
 * notices within a minute, and a backgrounded one notices the moment it is
 * looked at. `/api/health` touches nothing upstream, so the cost is one small
