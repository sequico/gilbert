 * Share hands the bytes straight to whatever they meant to send them to, which
 * is the thing they were actually trying to do.
 *
 * Every entry point feature-detects and disappears where the API is not there
 * rather than failing at the tap: `navigator.share` is absent on desktop Linux
 * and in Firefox, exists on iOS and Android and on Windows and macOS Chrome,
 * and file sharing is a separate question from sharing at all.

 * this is what decides whether a Share button is drawn at all, and drawing one
 * that turns out to be a download in disguise is worse than not drawing it.
