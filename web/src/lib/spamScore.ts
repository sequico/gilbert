 * Nothing here scores anything. The server has already done that at delivery

 * costs nothing and cannot disagree with the filter that actually made the
 * decision.
 *
 * Two formats cover what sits in front of a Stalwart mailbox in practice: the
 * SpamAssassin-shaped `X-Spam-*` set, which Stalwart's own filter writes, and
 * Rspamd's `X-Spamd-Result`. Anything else is left unread rather than guessed
 * at -- a misparsed score shown confidently is worse than no panel.
 *
 * The one editorial decision: **a score is not shown without its threshold
 * where the header states one.** 6.7 is damning against a threshold of 5 and
 * unremarkable against 15, so the number alone is not something a reader can
 * act on. Where no threshold is stated, that is said rather than assumed.
