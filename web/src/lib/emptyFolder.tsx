/**
 * Emptying a folder, and asking first.
 *
 * There are three ways in — the folder's right-click menu, the list's own
 * menu, and the banner across the top of Junk Mail — and they must not drift
 * apart in what they warn about. A folder can only be emptied when it is one
 * whose whole purpose is holding things you did not want: Deleted Items, or
 * Junk Mail.
 *
 * The wording differs between them for a reason. Emptying Deleted Items is
 * what anyone expects it to do. Emptying Junk Mail is the surprising one: the
 * messages do not travel to Deleted Items on the way out, so there is no
 * second chance to change your mind, and the dialog says so rather than
 * leaving it to be discovered.
