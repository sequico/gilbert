 * `dn` does not change in the ten minutes between two attempts, which is the
 * interval that matters. An import is not a sync.
 *
 * Namespaced rather than stored raw, because it becomes the card's `uid` and
 * must not be mistaken for a UID a vCard author meant. The one way this can be
 * wrong: two directories that both contain `cn=John Smith`, imported into the
 * *same* address book, are one contact afterwards. Matching is per book, so
 * filing two directories in two books keeps them apart.
 *
 * Normalised for case and for the spacing exporters differ in, which costs
 * nothing when a file is compared against itself and helps when it is compared
 * against a differently-produced export of the same directory.
 *
 * Null for an entry with no usable `dn`: that entry gets an identity of its own
 * and duplicates on re-import, as everything did before.
