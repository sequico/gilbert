/**
 * Placeholders in templates, filled at the moment one is inserted.
 *
 * Two rules decide the whole design:
 *
 *  - **An unresolved placeholder is left exactly as written.** A template
 *    inserted before the message is addressed cannot know who it is going to,
 *    and substituting an empty string there produces "Hi ," -- a greeting that
 *    is wrong rather than unfinished. Leaving `{{recipientName}}` in the body
 *    says which word is still missing, and it can be typed over. It is also
 *    what makes inserting a template early a valid thing to do rather than a
 *    mistake to undo.
 *  - **A name that is not a placeholder is left alone too.** Templates are
 *    written by hand and `{{` is not reserved anywhere else, but a body that
 *    silently ate an unrecognised token would be worse than one that shows it.
 *
 * Dates and times go through `datetime.ts` rather than `toLocaleDateString`,
 * so a template follows the same date order and clock the rest of the app is
 * told to use.
