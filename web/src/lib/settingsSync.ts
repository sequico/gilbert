/**
 * Settings that follow the account rather than the browser.
 *
 * Everything used to live in localStorage, which meant no preference travelled
 * between devices — most painfully the default identity, where the fallback is
 * whichever address sorts first, so a forgotten setting sends mail from an
 * address the recipient may not know (issue #54).
 *
 * The store is a `settings.json` in the account's own JMAP Files, beside the
 * signature images that are already kept there. That keeps Gilbert itself
 * stateless: no volume, no database, nothing to back up separately, and the
 * settings are covered by whatever backs up the mail store.
 *
 * localStorage stays, demoted to a cache: it is what paints the first frame,
 * and the file overwrites it once it lands. A browser with no cache (a private
 * window) therefore shows defaults for one frame before the account's real
 * settings arrive.
