/**
 * `BASE_PATH` is typed into a compose file or a `docker run` line by hand, and
 * the four spellings below are all reasonable things for someone to write.
 * The one that has to be exactly right is the empty one: every deployment that
 * exists today is at the root, and this feature must be invisible to them.
 *
 * The canonical form is a leading slash and no trailing one, so that the
 * concatenation `${base}/api/health` is correct with no branch. A trailing
 * slash would make the empty case produce `//api/health`, which is not a path
 * on this host but a protocol-relative URL pointing at a host called `api` --
 * which is why the tests below check the joined result and not just the value.
