/**
 * The verification code a push subscription needs is written by the service
 * worker when no tab is open, and collected by the next tab to start. Both
 * sides have to name the same cache entry.
 *
 * A relative key does not do that. It is resolved against the URL of whoever
 * is asking: the worker lives at `<base>/sw.js`, so it wrote under `<base>/…`,
 * while a tab at `/mail/inbox/abc` looked under `/mail/inbox/…`. They agreed
 * only when the open page happened to be the root — and a subscription that
 * never gets its code back stays silent, which is indistinguishable from push
 * simply not working.
 *
 * These tests pin the shape of the key rather than the plumbing: what matters
 * is that it is absolute and anchored to the mount, so it cannot vary with the
 * route.
