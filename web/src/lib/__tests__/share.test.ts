/**
 * The outcomes are the whole of this module: what the callers do next is
 * decided entirely by which of the three comes back, and two of the three are
 * reached through an exception rather than a return.
 *
 * `unsupported` is the one worth guarding. It is the instruction to download
 * instead, and it has to cover the browser that cannot share files *and* the
 * share that was refused because the tap's activation ran out while the
 * attachment was fetched -- which arrives as an error indistinguishable from a
 * permissions refusal, and would otherwise reach the reader as a toast about
 * something they cannot act on.
