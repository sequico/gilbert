/**
 * Issue #111: a folder id the account does not have rendered the ordinary
 * empty state — "Nothing here. This folder is empty" — which is a claim about
 * a folder that is not there. A stale link read as a folder that had emptied
 * itself rather than one that was gone.
 *
 * The interesting case is not the unknown id. It is `loaded`: the folder list
 * arrives after the first paint, so for a moment *every* id is unknown,
 * including the right one. A version without that gate sends the reader to
 * their inbox from the folder they asked for, on every cold load, and looks
 * exactly like a flaky link.
