/**
 * Found by sharing a folder between two real accounts.
 *
 * Switching to the account somebody shared pointed everything at it, because
 * the rule was "use the selected account if it can do this" and a shared file
 * account can, by definition, do files. Gilbert keeps its own settings in the
 * account's Files, so changing any setting while looking at somebody's shared
 * folder wrote `settings.json` into *their* storage, creating the `ihasmail`
 * folder there to do it. Reading someone else's data by mistake is bad; writing
 * yours into it is worse, and it was the same one-line rule doing both.
