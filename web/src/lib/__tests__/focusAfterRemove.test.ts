/**
 * Issue #71, both halves of it, reduced to the arithmetic they turn on.
 *
 * After deleting a row from the keyboard, `focusId` used to keep pointing at
 * the row that had gone. Two things fell out of that:
 *
 *   - `targetIds()` falls back to the focused id, so the next `#` re-targeted
 *     the deleted message. The optimistic update had already moved it into
 *     Deleted Items, so it looked like a permanent delete and raised a
 *     confirmation the user had switched off.
 *   - `moveFocus` read `ids.indexOf(focusId)` as -1 and treated that as
 *     "before the first row", so `k` clamped to the top of the list.
 *
 * Clicking was unaffected: it sets focus to a row that exists. That is why it
 * only ever happened from the keyboard.
