/*
 * The rule: `htmlBody` is derived, so its presence proves nothing. Only the
 * part's own type says whether there is an HTML alternative to render.
 *
 * The shapes below are what Stalwart 0.16.21 actually returned for one thread
 * on 2026-09-10, read back through `Email/get` with
 * `bodyProperties: ["partId", "type"]`. A plain-text message named the *same*
 * part in both lists; a message with a real alternative named two.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is not a rendering nicety. Plain text went to the HTML
 * path, which places the body under `white-space: normal`, so every line break
 * collapsed: hard-wrapped mail arrived as one paragraph, and the signature and
 * the quoted reply ran into the prose.
