/**
 * Whether a shared collection counts as added.

 * JMAP keeps this on the collection, in `isSubscribed`, and that is the better
 * place: a preference the server holds is one every client sees. But
 * subscribing writes to the *owner's* account, and Stalwart 0.16.19 refuses
 * that for an address book shared read-only — "You are not allowed to modify
 * this address book" — while accepting the identical write on a shared
 * calendar. Confirmed against the live server on 2026-08-27, from a second
 * account holding the share.
 *
 * So there are two records and either counts. The rule is the whole of the
 * fix, which is why it is worth pinning down here rather than leaving it
 * spelled out in three components that could drift apart.
