/**
 * These fixtures are real. Each was produced by `openssl smime -sign` against a
 * generated certificate, not written by hand — a hand-built signed message
 * tests the parser against the author's belief about the format, agrees with
 * every mistake in it, and is exactly how a verifier ends up passing its own
 * suite and failing on the first message anybody actually sends.
 *
 * The tampered fixture is the same signed message with one word of the body
 * changed and the signature left alone, which is the case the whole feature
 * exists to catch.
