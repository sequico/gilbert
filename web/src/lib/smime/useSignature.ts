/**
 * Checking the signature on the message being read.

 * Two things this is careful about, both about not doing work:
 *
 *   - The verifier is imported dynamically. Signed mail is rare, and DER
 *     parsing plus certificate reading has no business in the bundle everybody
 *     downloads to read an unsigned message.
 *   - Nothing is fetched unless the message says it is signed. The structure
 *     already came with the message, so the common answer costs one string
 *     comparison and no network at all.
