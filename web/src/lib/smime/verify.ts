/**
 * Checking an S/MIME signature, and deciding what may honestly be said about it.
 *
 * Two questions are kept deliberately apart, because conflating them is how
 * signature UI becomes a lie:
 *
 *   1. **Did this signature verify?** Pure arithmetic. Either the bytes hash to
 *      what the signature says they hash to, or they do not.
 *   2. **Does that mean anything?** Much weaker. The certificate travels inside
 *      the message, so anyone can self-sign as anyone: on its own, a verified
 *      signature proves only that whoever wrote the message also held the key
 *      in the certificate attached to it.
 *
 * What makes the second question worth asking at all is remembering the answer.
 * The first signed message from an address pins that certificate's fingerprint;
 * later ones are compared against it. That is trust on first use, and it is a
 * genuinely useful thing to tell somebody -- "the same signer as every time
 * before", or, much more loudly, "this is not the signer you saw before" --
 * without a certificate authority anywhere in the picture.
 *
 * So nothing here ever renders the bare word "verified". The caller is given
 * the crypto result and the trust judgement separately, and has to say both.
