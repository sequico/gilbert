/**
 * Read receipts (Message Disposition Notifications, RFC 8098).

 * JMAP has an extension for this -- RFC 9007's `MDN/send` -- and Stalwart does
 * not implement it: `urn:ietf:params:jmap:mdn` is absent from its capability
 * list. So ihasmail builds the report itself and sends it like any other
 * message: raw MIME, uploaded as a blob, imported, submitted.
 *
 * The plumbing is the easy half. A read receipt tells a stranger that a
 * specific address is live, was read, and when -- which is precisely what
 * a spammer wants to learn, and the sender chooses the address it goes to.
 * The rules in `mdnDecision` below are what keep that from being automatic.
