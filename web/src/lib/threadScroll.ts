/**
 * Where a conversation opens.
 *
 * The pane opens on the first unread message. Opening on the newest is wrong
 * whenever anything in the thread is unread: the unread mail sits above the
 * fold, and the only clue it exists is the marker on a message you have to
 * scroll up to find. The auto-mark-read timer then sweeps the whole thread, so
 * scrolling up late is scrolling up to mail that is already marked read (#87).
 *
 * Order is receivedAt, not arrival, so the first unread is not the second-to-
 * last message or any other position you can guess at. A thread where one
 * participant's server queued a message for hours delivers it late and sorts it
 * early -- exactly the case where opening at the bottom hides the most.
 *
 * Two answers are "don't move":
 *
 *   - a single message, which is already the whole pane
 *   - the first unread being the first message, where the top of the pane
 *     shows it anyway, together with the subject
 *
 * `unread` is the set captured when the thread was opened rather than live
 * `$seen` state, for the same reason expansion uses it: the mark-read timer
 * must not change the shape of what you are looking at (#69).
