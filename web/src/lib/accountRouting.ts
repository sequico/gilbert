/**
 * Which account a request goes to.
 *
 * A JMAP session lists more than one account whenever anything is shared with
 * you: the sharer's account appears alongside your own, carrying whichever
 * capabilities they shared. Switching to one is how you read their files, so
 * some requests have to follow that selection.
 *
 * Others must never follow it, and telling the two apart is the whole point of
 * this file. ihasmail keeps its own settings in the account's Files — that is
 * what makes them travel between devices — and a shared file account advertises
 * the file capability by definition. So the obvious rule, "use whichever
 * account is selected if it can do this", writes your settings into the other
 * person's storage the moment you change one while looking at their folder. It
 * would create the `ihasmail` folder there to do it.
 *
 * Two questions, then, and they have different answers:
 *
 *   - what am I *looking at*  -> `accountForCapability`, follows the selection
 *   - what is *mine*          -> `ownAccountForCapability`, never does
 *
 * There is a third rule hiding in the first. A capability the selected account
 * does not advertise used to fall back to that account anyway, so a session
 * with no primary account for something would aim it at whoever was selected —
 * someone else. Falling back to nothing is the honest answer: the feature is
 * unavailable, which is true, rather than pointed at a stranger's data.
