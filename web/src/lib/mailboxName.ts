/**
 * What to call a folder on screen.
 *
 * Stalwart names the standard folders once, when the account is created, in
 * whatever language the server was set up in — and never renames them
 * afterwards, because the name is stored data every other client has mapped.
 * So a German reader on an English-provisioned account sees "Deleted Items"
 * in an otherwise German app, and there is nothing the server can be asked to
 * do about it: the account locale exists in `x:AccountSettings`, but writing it
 * needs `sysAccountSettingsSet`, which the built-in user role does not carry.
 *
 * The role is the way out. JMAP tags the standard folders — `inbox`, `trash`,
 * `drafts` and the rest — and Gilbert already trusts the role rather than the
 * name everywhere it matters, so the display name can follow the interface
 * language without anything being written to the server.
 *
 * Only the roles. A folder somebody made and called "Newsletters" keeps that
 * name, because those are their words and translating them would be inventing
 * a folder they never made.
 *
 * The cost, and it is real: another client on the same account still shows
 * "Deleted Items", because that is what the folder is called. Within Gilbert
 * this stays consistent — everything that names a folder goes through here,
 * including the "moved to …" toast, which exists precisely so that message
 * does not name somewhere the reader cannot find.
 */
/*
 * Every one of these is translated in the "folder" context, including the
 * unambiguous ones. Two of them genuinely need it -- "Archive" is also the
 * button that archives, "Important" is also a priority tag, and German wants a
 * different word for each -- and applying it to only those two would leave the
 * next person to notice which. A context on all of them is one rule.
