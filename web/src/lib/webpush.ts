/**
 * Web Push: notifications that arrive when Gilbert is not open.
 *
 * The existing EventSource channel only lives as long as a tab does, so
 * "desktop notifications" have really meant "while you are looking". Stalwart
 * 0.16 signs Web Push with VAPID (RFC 9749) and can carry the message itself in
 * the payload (draft-ietf-jmap-emailpush), so the browser's own push service
 * delivers a useful notification with Gilbert closed.
 *
 * Nothing in this path touches Gilbert's server. Stalwart talks to the push
 * service directly; the only thing proxied is the JMAP call that registers the
 * subscription. That is deliberate — it is why this needs no relay, no extra
 * service to run, and no third party beyond the browser vendor's push endpoint
 * that Web Push requires of everyone.
 *
 * Verified against the live 0.16.19 before this was written: the server
 * publishes a real `applicationServerKey`, and `PushSubscription/get` answers a
 * normal user rather than refusing them.
