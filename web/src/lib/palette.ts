/**
 * Palettes, and the two axes they replaced.
 *
 * The theme used to be one enum — `system | light | dark | gilbert` — where
 * "gilbert" carried a whole palette and implied dark. That works for exactly
 * one palette. With several, the two questions come apart: **which palette**
 * (the colours) and **which mode** (light or dark), and they are chosen
 * separately.
 *
 * Every palette here is taken from the project that publishes it, all MIT, and
 * from that project's own repository rather than from anyone's reimplementation
 * of it. The values are recorded in `.palette-sources/palettes-upstream.md` so
 * the derivation can be checked rather than taken on trust.
