 * Markdown, rendered for the file viewer.
 *
 * The source is somebody else's file -- uploaded, or shared into the account
 * by another user -- so it is treated as hostile. Markdown is not a safe
 * subset of anything: raw HTML passes straight through it by design, so
 * `<script>` in a .md is a script tag unless something takes it out. That
 * something is DOMPurify, which the app already carries for mail.
 *
 * Rendered inline rather than in a shadow root the way mail bodies are: this
 * output is ours, sanitised and styled by `.md-body`, where an email arrives
 * with a design of its own that has to be quarantined from the app's.
