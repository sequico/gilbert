 * - `pushDeviceId` is a random id for this browser, so re-subscribing replaces
 *   rather than accumulates. The subscription itself is removed on sign-out.
 * - `pushEnabled` records that background notifications were switched on here,
 *   and is what the renewal on app start keys off. It is kept because this
 *   function runs on two different endings and only one of them is a sign-out:
 *   a *deploy* expires every session, and the handler for that clears local
 *   data without removing the push subscription, because there is no longer a
 *   session to remove it with. Dropping the flag there would leave the
 *   subscription registered, the switch still reading as on, and nothing
 *   renewing it -- so push would go quiet a week after every deploy, which is
 *   the exact failure the renewal exists to prevent. Signing out for real
