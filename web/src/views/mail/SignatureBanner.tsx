/**
 * What a checked signature is allowed to say on screen.
 *
 * The wording here is the feature. ihasmail has no certificate authority to ask
 * and none is bundled, so the strong word — "verified", full stop — is never
 * used: the certificate arrives inside the message, and on its own a good
 * signature only shows that whoever wrote the message held the key attached to
 * it. What can honestly be said is whether this is the same signer as last
 * time, and that is what the banner leads with.
 *
 * Which means the *reassuring* case is deliberately the quiet one and the
 * changed-signer case is the loud one. A green tick on a first sighting would
 * be telling somebody that an unknown certificate is trustworthy because it
 * verified against itself.
