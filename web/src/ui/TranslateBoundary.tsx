/**
 * A boundary that survives Chrome translating the page.
 *
 * Chrome's translator rewrites the rendered DOM directly, wrapping text nodes
 * in `<font>` elements React has never heard of. React holds references to the
 * nodes it created, so the next update calls `removeChild` or `insertBefore`
 * against a parent whose children have moved, the DOM throws, and the whole
 * component tree unmounts. It is a longstanding React/Chromium problem
 * (facebook/react#11538), not a fault in anything here, and it cannot be
 * fixed from inside React.
 *
 * `translate="no"` and the structural wrapping elsewhere in this change make
 * it rarer. Neither makes it impossible: those are hints to the automatic
 * prompt, and a reader can always force a translation from the extension
 * regardless of what the page asked for. So the last line is to catch it and
 * put the subtree back.
 *
 * Recovery is a remount rather than a crash screen, because there is nothing
 * to lose: this wraps the main content area only, so the header, the sidebar
 * and any open composer are outside it and keep their state. What is inside
 * re-derives from the stores, which is where it came from a moment ago.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. A boundary is a class component because React offers no
 * hook for this, and that is the whole of the cost -- no dependency, no
 * context, no stored state.
