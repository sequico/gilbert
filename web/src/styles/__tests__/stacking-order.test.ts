/**
 * The drawer is a phone's only way to a folder, an event, a contact or a new
 * message -- and each of those answers with a dialog or a full-screen composer
 * that must sit above it, not below. Nothing
 * in a component test sees that: jsdom has no paint order, and the store is
 * perfectly happy while the dialog sits behind the thing that raised it.
 *
 * So the guard is on the stylesheet, which is where the stacking lives.
 *
 * Read off disk, not imported: `?raw` comes back empty for a stylesheet under
 * vitest, which would pass every assertion below on an empty string.
