/*
 * Emptying an address book, and deleting a selection of contacts.
 *
 * Asked for on #174 as the other half of a migration: import, notice something
 * is wrong, empty the book, correct the export, import again. Without empty and
 * multi-select, the only way to delete a contact is one card at a time from its
 * own pane, and the only way to empty a book is to delete the book and build it
 * again -- losing its name, its sharing and its default status (#277).
 *
 * The part worth testing hardest is the one that is not a deletion. A card
 * filed in two books belongs to both, and `ContactCard/set destroy` takes it
 * away from both at once. Emptying one book must not empty another.
