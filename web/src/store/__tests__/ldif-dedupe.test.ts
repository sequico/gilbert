/*
 * Re-importing an LDIF address book you already have.
 *
 * Mozilla's schema has no UID, so for a long time an LDIF re-import duplicated
 * everything -- reported on #174, tracked on #223, and reported again once the
 * vCard half shipped without it. The entry's `dn` is the identity the file
 * actually carries: not durable enough to be anyone's identity forever, and
 * unchanged across the ten minutes between importing a migration, spotting a
 * mistake, correcting the export and importing again, which is the only
 * interval an import has to survive.
 *
 * Updated rather than skipped, because the reason to import a file twice is
 * that the first attempt was not right.
