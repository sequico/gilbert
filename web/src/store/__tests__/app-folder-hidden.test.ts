/**
 * The `gilbert` app folder (the client's own; a leftover `ihasmail` one is
 * renamed to it on first open) holds signature images and the synced settings file.
 * They are real nodes in the account — that is what makes them travel — but
 * they are the client's housekeeping, so Files does not show them.
 *
 * Hiding the folder alone is worse than showing it: the tree attaches a node
 * whose parent is missing to the root, so the signature images would spill out
 * into the top level looking like the user's own files.
