/**
 * Switching to an account somebody shared with you showed an empty folder tree.
 *
 * The switch cleared `nodes` and `children` and stopped there, so `treeLoaded`
 * stayed true from the previous account — the sidebar never asked the new one
 * for its folders — while `dirIds` still named the old account's folders, which
 * no longer resolved against the cleared `nodes`. The result was a tree with
 * nothing in it and no error to explain it, in the one place a tree matters
 * most: someone else's files, where you have no idea what the shape should be.
 *
 * The test that matters is the last one. The bug was not bad logic, it was a
 * field nobody remembered, and the only durable guard is asserting the whole
 * set rather than the fields we happen to think of today.
