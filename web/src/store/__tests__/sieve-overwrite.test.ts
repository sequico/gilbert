/**
 * Issue #76: adding a filter from a message reported success, and the script
 * on the server never held more than two rules.
 *
 * The chain was three links long, and each looked reasonable alone:
 *
 *   1. `load()` recorded a *failed* blob fetch as `contents[id] = ""`.
 *   2. `sieveToRules("")` returns `[]` — "this script has no rules", which is
 *      indistinguishable from "we could not read this script".
 *   3. Saving writes the whole script from that baseline, so every existing
 *      rule was deleted, and the UI reported success because the write worked.
 *
 * The fix is to keep "unknown" and "empty" apart at every step. These pin that:
 * an unreadable script must never present as an empty one.
