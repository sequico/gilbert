/*
 * Who a reply is addressed to.
 *
 * The hard half is replying to something *I* sent, which is what following up
 * on your own last message is. The conversation is with the people I wrote to;
 * addressing the reply to myself, or to my own Reply-To, sends it nowhere
 * useful -- and on a Reply all it quietly demotes everyone I was talking to
 * into Cc.
 *
 * There was a guard for this and it was sound. What it rested on was not: it
 * asked whether an address was in the identity list, which is empty before
 * identities load, misses an alias or a shared mailbox the server does not list
 * as an identity, and compared strings where the rest of the codebase uses
 * `sameAddress`. Each miss was silent. So the folder is asked first -- a
 * message in Sent is mine whatever address it went out as -- and the identity
 * list is the second opinion rather than the only one (#275).
