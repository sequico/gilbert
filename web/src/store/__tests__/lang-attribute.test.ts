 * against the language the page declares. A `lang` patched in from a
 * `useEffect` leaves a window where the two disagree, and that window is
 * enough to raise the prompt on a page that was already in the reader's
 * language — after which accepting it rewrites the DOM under React.
 *
 * Two halves, and they are different claims: the served HTML already says so,
 * and the stored preference is applied without waiting for a render.
