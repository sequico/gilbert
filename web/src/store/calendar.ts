 * Which account holds a calendar, from a bare id.

 * group's can both be "t1", and two shared accounts can collide too. A bare
 * id that names more than one reachable calendar is ambiguous and resolves to
 * null -- "Calendar is not available" at every call site -- rather than to a
 * guess, because a guess would aim an edit at the wrong account's same-id
 * calendar. Resolution is unambiguous when exactly one side holds the id:
 *
 *  - only the reader's own account holds it → the reader's own account;
 *  - exactly one shared/group account holds it → that account;
 *  - nobody reachable holds it → the reader's own account, the historical
 *    answer for an id whose calendar has not loaded yet (a caller that
 *    really means a group event passes the account explicitly and never
 *    reaches this guess);
 *  - the own account and a shared one both hold it, or two shared accounts
 *    do → null, since the bare id cannot tell which was meant.
 *
 * Callers that know the account (every view path, since an instance carries
 * its account) pass it explicitly and never reach this guess. No id at all
 * means a brand-new event, which starts on the reader's own account.
