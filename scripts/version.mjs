/**
 * Work out this build's version: `2026.8.30+pr129`.
 *
 *   2026.8.30  the date of the commit this was built from
 *   +pr129     the pull request it arrived through
 *
 * The date leads because ihasmail's version used to be `2.16.<pr>`, where `16`
 * was the Stalwart generation it targeted -- and Stalwart 1.0 will leave that
 * with nowhere to go. `2.1` would sort *below* the `2.16` already deployed, so
 * every image and About screen would read as a downgrade. Tying our
 * numbering to somebody else's was the mistake; which Stalwart a build needs is
 * said properly in the README badge and KNOWN-ISSUES, where it can be precise
 * ("0.16 or newer; tested against 0.16.20") rather than one digit.
 *
 * The pull request moved into build metadata, after the `+`, because it is
 * provenance rather than a position in a sequence: at a hundred merges a week
 * it climbs without bound and says nothing about how new a build is. SemVer
 * ignores everything after the `+` when comparing versions, which is the right
 * reading -- two builds from the same day differ in where they came from, not
 * in rank. Nothing here relies on that comparison anyway: images are pruned
 * oldest-first by creation time and rollbacks name a git ref.
 *
 * A commit that did not arrive through a pull request carries its short SHA
 * instead -- `2026.8.30+g1fa6578` -- which is honest about being some commit on
 * that day rather than claiming a pull request it was only built after.
 *
 * The date is the commit's own, not today's, so rebuilding an old commit gives
 * the same answer it gave the first time. It comes from the commit object,
 * timezone included, so two machines agree.
 *
 * Nothing writes a version back into the tree: a committed one would always be
 * describing a merge that had not happened yet, and every branch would collide
 * on the same line. `package.json` no longer carries it either -- npm wants the
 * field, so it stays at `0.0.0`, which is what an unversioned build reports and
 * is meant to look wrong.
 *
 * `.dockerignore` excludes `.git`, so an image build cannot run any of this.
 * It takes the answer through `--build-arg GILBERT_VERSION=...` instead, and
 * whoever builds is responsible for computing it -- see gilbert-deploy.sh.
