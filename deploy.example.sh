# Redeploy ihasmail on a single-host Docker setup, from a git checkout.
#
# Copy it, or run it as-is and set the variables below in the environment.
# Nothing here is specific to any one host: the defaults describe the shape of
# a deployment rather than anyone's particular one.
#
# Usage: ./deploy.sh [git-ref] [-y|--yes] [-n|--dry-run]
#
# Three guards stand between a careless run and production:
#
#   .deploy-hold  commits that must not reach prod yet, one per line. If the
#                 target contains one that is not already deployed, the deploy
#                 is refused outright -- `--yes` does not override it. Clearing
#                 a hold means deleting its line, which is a deliberate edit.
#
#   confirmation  anything introducing new commits is listed first and has to
#                 be confirmed. Over SSH, where there is no terminal to answer
#                 on, that means passing --yes: a bare `deploy.sh` cannot ship
#                 whatever main happens to have picked up since the last
#                 release.
#
#   --dry-run     checks the hold list, says what it would deploy, and stops
#                 before building or touching the container. It does not ask
#                 for confirmation: there is nothing to agree to when nothing
#                 changes, and needing a terminal would make it useless over
#                 SSH -- which is where wanting to look before leaping is most
#                 likely.
#
# The container is replaced rather than restarted, because the image is rebuilt
# from the new checkout. Data lives in a named volume and survives that; the
# environment file is never read here, only handed to Docker.

# --- what to deploy, and where ----------------------------------------------
# The checkout to deploy from. It must be a git clone: the version number is
# read from its history (see scripts/version.mjs).
APP="${IHASMAIL_APP:-$HOME/apps/ihasmail}"
# Environment file passed to the container. Keep it outside the repo's tracked
# files -- it holds APP_SECRET and the upstream URL. Never read by this script.
ENVF="${IHASMAIL_ENV:-$APP/.env.production}"
# Commits held back from production, one per line; blank or missing is fine.
HOLD="${IHASMAIL_HOLD:-$APP/.deploy-hold}"
# Container name, and where to publish it. The default binds to loopback only,
# for a reverse proxy in front (see Caddyfile.example / nginx.example.conf).
NAME="${IHASMAIL_NAME:-ihasmail}"
BIND="${IHASMAIL_BIND:-127.0.0.1:8090}"
# Named volume for /data (sessions). Unused when running immutably.
# Renamed ihasmail-data → gilbert-data on 2026-09-06: the name is deployed
# state, so an existing host either copies the old volume once or accepts a
# re-login — /data only mirrors sessions, never durable account data.
VOLUME="${IHASMAIL_VOLUME:-gilbert-data}"
# Run the container immutably: read-only root filesystem, no volume, sessions
# held in memory only. See "Running immutably" in the README. The server is told
# the same thing through IMMUTABLE=1 and checks it, so a half-applied switch --
# the flag without the read-only filesystem, or a SESSION_FILE still pointing
# somewhere -- refuses to start here instead of looking fine until the next
# redeploy signs everyone out.
#
# It defaults to on, and the reason is what happens when it does not. Forgetting
# the variable used to hand back a writable container with a volume mounted --
# quietly, and then report healthy. Nothing in the output said the immutability
# had gone; `docker inspect` was the only place it showed. So the safe posture
# is what you get by default, and giving it up is the half that has to be
# deliberate, which is the way round these two should always have been.
#
# The standing cost is that sessions do not outlive a deploy, because there is
# nowhere left to keep them. Going back is this variable and nothing else:
#
#   IHASMAIL_IMMUTABLE=0 ./ihasmail-deploy.sh --yes
#
# The named volume is never touched either way, so whatever was in it when the
# switch was thrown is still there to come back to.
IMMUTABLE="${IHASMAIL_IMMUTABLE:-1}"
# Image repository. Each build is tagged with its version as well, so an
# earlier one can be run again without rebuilding it.
IMAGE_REPO="${IHASMAIL_IMAGE:-ihasmail}"
# How long to wait for the new container to report healthy, in seconds.
HEALTH_TIMEOUT="${IHASMAIL_HEALTH_TIMEOUT:-30}"
# How many past versions to keep as images, for rolling back to. Each is around
# 650 MB, and a deploy adds one, so left alone they accumulate a gigabyte every
# couple of releases -- and `docker image prune` will not touch them, because
# they are tagged. 0 keeps every version.

# wherever it had reached. Silently, and with exit status 0: a deploy that
# stopped halfway would report success. Re-exec from a copy outside the tree so
