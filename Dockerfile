# build. It cannot be worked out in here -- .dockerignore keeps .git out of the

# in a checkout prints the right answer; ihasmail-deploy.sh passes it through.
# Left empty, the build falls back to the base version from package.json.

# is the domain root and is what every deployment gets unless it asks
# otherwise. Unlike the rest of ihasmail's configuration this cannot wait for
# the process to start: the web build writes its own asset URLs into
# index.html, so a build that does not know the prefix produces a shell that
# cannot load itself under one. It is therefore a build argument here and an
# environment variable in the runtime stage, from the same value.

# No `VOLUME ["/data"]`. It reads like documentation for where the session file
# goes, but Docker acts on it: a container started without `-v` gets an
# anonymous volume mounted there anyway, and that mount stays writable even
# under `--read-only`. So the directive quietly put a writable hole in a
# container meant to be immutable, and left an orphaned volume behind every
# time one was replaced -- while never persisting anything across a redeploy,
# since each new container got a fresh empty volume of its own. Deployments
# that want the sessions to survive say so themselves: docker-compose.yml and
# deploy.example.sh both mount a *named* volume at /data, which is unaffected.
EXPOSE 8080
# Shell form, so $BASE_PATH is expanded by the container rather than baked in
# empty at build time: the health endpoint moves with the mount.
#
# The two substitutions repeat, in sh, what scripts/basePath.mjs does in
# JavaScript -- drop a trailing slash, add a leading one -- because this runs
# before there is a Node process to ask. It is worth the duplication: an
# operator who writes BASE_PATH=mail/ gets a working server, and without this
# a healthcheck that says the working server is unhealthy and has Docker
# restart it forever.
