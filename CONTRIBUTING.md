# Contributing to Gilbert

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Gilbert** — a Gmail-style, JMAP-only webmail client for [Stalwart Mail Server](https://stalw.art/). Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, feature requests, code, documentation, and testing.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to treat other contributors with respect. Be constructive, be patient with newcomers, and keep discussion focused on the project. Harassment or abusive behavior toward other contributors will not be tolerated.

## Before You Start

- Gilbert speaks **JMAP only** — it does not support IMAP/POP3/SMTP fallback paths. Keep this in mind when proposing features.
- Gilbert has **no database of its own** — all state lives in Stalwart via JMAP. Contributions should not introduce a separate persistence layer without discussion first.
- This project is licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. Any code you contribute will be distributed under this license, including for hosted/SaaS deployments.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before opening a new issue, please search [existing issues](https://github.com/sequico/gilbert/issues) to see if it's already been reported. When filing a bug report, include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- Your environment: browser/OS, Stalwart version, and how Gilbert is deployed (Docker, bare metal, etc.)
- Relevant logs, console errors, or screenshots
- Whether the issue is reproducible against a fresh Stalwart instance

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue describing:

- The problem you're trying to solve (not just the solution)
- How it fits with Gilbert's JMAP-only, Gmail-style design philosophy
- Any relevant JMAP RFC references (RFC 8620, RFC 8621) if the feature touches protocol behavior

For larger changes, please open an issue to discuss the approach **before** submitting a pull request — this saves everyone time if the direction needs adjusting.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Name your branch** descriptively, e.g. `fix/thread-view-scroll` or `feat/search-filters`.
3. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR. Large, unrelated changes bundled together are harder to review and more likely to be rejected.
4. **Write clear commit messages** describing what changed and why.
5. **Test your changes** against a real (or local) Stalwart instance where possible, since JMAP behavior can be subtle.
6. **Update documentation** if your change affects setup, configuration, or user-facing behavior.
7. **Open the pull request** against `main`, filling out the PR template with:
   - A summary of the change
   - Related issue number(s), if any
   - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
   - Any manual testing you performed
8. **Add translations** for any new user-visible string. Ten languages ship
   alongside English in `web/src/locales/`, and a missing key renders its
   English source rather than failing — so an untranslated string is invisible
   until somebody reading that language finds it. `npm run i18n:check` and
   `node scripts/i18n-catalog-check.mjs` report where you stand; the catalogue
   key for a plural is the `other` form.

`main` is not branch-protected. The gate that keeps a broken change off it is
the fast CI check every push runs — `npm run prepush`: typecheck, Biome lint,
and the test suite in UTC — enforced by the pre-push hook in `.githooks/`. A
push that fails the gate is refused; bypass it with `--no-verify` only
deliberately and knowingly.

### Code Style

- Match the existing formatting and naming conventions used elsewhere in the codebase.
- **Formatting and linting are Biome's** (`biome.jsonc`, calibrated to this repo's style): run `npm run lint` to check and `npm run lint:fix` to apply before committing.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose where practical.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness — this is a mail client people rely on for their inbox.
- Comment non-obvious JMAP interactions, especially around state/`changes` handling, since JMAP's delta-sync model can be easy to get subtly wrong.

### Translations

Ten languages ship alongside English: German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch,
Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Ukrainian, Simplified Chinese and Japanese, in
`web/src/locales/`. A missing key renders its English source rather than
failing, so an untranslated string is invisible until somebody reading that
language finds it.

**Any change that adds or alters a user-visible string adds work in all ten
catalogues.** Say so explicitly in the PR — how many keys, and the fallback
count before and after — and say so just as explicitly when a change adds none,
so it is never left to be inferred.

#### The catalogue key for a plural is the `other` form

`plural()` looks the entry up by `forms.other`, so a call site written as

```ts
plural(n, { one: "Deleted {n} contact", other: "Deleted {n} contacts" })
```

is keyed on **`"Deleted {n} contacts"`**. Keying the catalogue on the `one`
form type-checks, builds, passes every test, and silently falls back to English
in all ten languages. Nothing errors. The only signal is the fallback count
going up, so read it:

```sh
npm run i18n:check                    # literals wrapped, and catalogue health
node scripts/i18n-catalog-check.mjs   # per-language: translated / used / falling back
```

Compare the "falling back to English" number against `main` before and after.
It should not rise. Do not read the percentage instead — adding keys moves the
denominator, so it can hold steady while new strings go untranslated.

Plural forms are per language, from `Intl.PluralRules`: `one`/`other` for most,
`one`/`few`/`many`/`other` for Russian and Ukrainian, `other` alone for Japanese
and Chinese. Supplying a form a language does not draw is inventing a
distinction, not being thorough.

### Verifying UI work

Store tests do not exercise the component. A range measured inside a
`setState` updater, for instance, is applied after React has already moved the
anchor that measured it: every store assertion can pass while the built app
does the wrong thing. If a change is visible on screen,
run it: `npm run dev:mock` (mock Stalwart, credentials printed on start), then
drive the real thing. Add a component test for what you find; there are
examples in `web/src/views/*/__tests__/`.

### Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sequico/gilbert.git
   cd gilbert
   ```
2. Point your local instance at a running Stalwart Mail Server (a test/dev instance is strongly recommended — do not develop against a production mailbox).
3. Follow the setup instructions in the repository's `README.md` for installing dependencies and running the app locally.
4. Verify your changes don't break existing JMAP calls by exercising core flows: login, list/read mail, send, search, and folder/label operations.

## Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes.
- Please respond to review feedback in a timely manner; PRs with no activity for an extended period may be closed and can be reopened once updated.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, report them privately by emailing **johnellisATlinuxDOTcom** with details of the issue. See `SECURITY.md` if one is present in the repo for further instructions.

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something is a good fit, open an issue and ask — discussion is welcome before you invest time in a PR.

Thanks again for helping improve Gilbert!
