/**
 * Gilbert requires Stalwart 0.16 or newer. Sign-in is where that is enforced,
 * and it matters that it is enforced *there*: the alternative is signing
 * someone in and letting Files, the account locale and self-service
 * credentials each fail in their own way, with nothing to connect the three or
 * to say what the real problem is.
 *
 * The refusal also has to keep two things apart that look the same from the
 * outside. Bad credentials are a 401 the user can fix by typing again; an
 * unsupported server is not, and telling someone their password is wrong when
 * it is not would send them round in circles.
