 * permission, which the built-in `user` role is not given, and a locale read
 * from there alone silently falls back to the browser locale. Stalwart 0.16
 * exposes the same field on `x:AccountSettings`, which users *can* read, so
 * both are asked for and whichever answers wins. Both are 0.16 methods: this is
