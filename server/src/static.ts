/*
 * Files that must not be served from anybody's cache, the way index.html is
 * not.
 *
 * Sending them with `max-age=3600` looks harmless -- they are neither hashed
 * assets nor HTML -- and it is not, for two of them, with a CDN in front making
 * it worse: on a deploy the origin serves the new build while the edge goes on
 * handing out the previous `sw.js`, `cf-cache-status: HIT`, on an edge TTL of
 * its own that is longer than what was asked for.
 *
 * What that costs is specific rather than general. The service worker is the
 * app's whole update mechanism: a stale one keeps serving the shell it knows
 * and never learns there is a newer build, so the deploy simply does not
 * arrive. And a manifest and a worker that disagree is worse than either being
 * old -- a fresh manifest advertising a share target to the operating system,
 * answered by a worker that has never heard of one, sends the share to the
 * server for a 405.
 *
 * `no-cache` does not mean "do not store": the browser and the CDN may both
 * keep it and revalidate, which is a 304 and costs nothing. It means neither
 * gets to serve it without asking first, which is the whole requirement.
