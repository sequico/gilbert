/**
 * What the JMAP proxy lets through for a session that may not administer:

 * in without "This is my own device".
 *
 * Hiding the menu is not turning it off (ADR 0001, ADR 0014). `/api/jmap`
 * forwards any method the browser sends, and Stalwart's registry answers
 * whatever the credential's role allows — so without this, an administrator
 * could still manage accounts, or the whole server, from the browser console
 * of an installation whose operator said no. With it off, the proxy refuses
 * every `x:` method except the few that are about the signed-in account
 * itself.
 *
 * An allowlist rather than a list of administrative objects, because the
 * registry has dozens of them — listeners, stores, tracers, system settings —
 * and a new release adds more. An object not named here is refused, which errs
 * toward the operator's decision.
 *
 * The standard JMAP methods (mail, calendars, contacts, files, sharing) are
 * not touched: they act on what the account can already reach.
