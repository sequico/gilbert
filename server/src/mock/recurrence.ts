/**
 * Enough recurrence expansion for the mock to behave like Stalwart 0.16.20.
 *
 * The mock used to hand a recurring event back once, as its stored self. Three
 * things that only a live server showed were therefore impossible to develop
 * against, and all three had already cost a debugging session:
 *
 * - an expanded query gives *everything* a synthetic id over a `baseEventId`,
 *   a one-off included, so `baseEventId` is no evidence of a series;
 * - an occurrence carries a `recurrenceId` and no rule of its own;
 * - 0.16.20 takes a write aimed at a synthetic id and turns it into a
 *   `recurrenceOverrides` entry rather than touching the series.
 *
 * A mock that agrees with the client rather than with the server is how #26 and
 * #30 reached a live instance, so the refusals matter as much as the successes:
 * what Stalwart rejects is rejected here, and what it drops in silence is
 * dropped here, in silence, on purpose.

 * Stalwart's are opaque; the mock's are parseable because it has to resolve
 * them, and nothing in Gilbert may read either.
 *
 * They are also deliberately **unstable**, because the real ones are.
 * **Confirmed live on 0.16.20 (2026-08-31):** a synthetic id encodes a position
 * in the expanded series, and writing a `recurrenceOverrides` entry adds a
 * component that renumbers it. A five-week series held `e i m q u` over
 * 03-01…03-29; after one override was written to 03-08 the same ids addressed
 * 03-01, 03-15, 03-29, 03-08, 03-22. Nothing was rejected — they just meant
 * different dates.
 *
 * That is the hazard worth reproducing, and note which way round it goes: a
 * stale id is not *invalid*, it is *wrong*. A mock that expired them instead
 * would hand back a loud `notFound` and let a client that caches ids look
 * careful. So the numbering is shifted by the number of overrides — an
 * arbitrary stand-in for Stalwart's renumbering, with the one property that
 * matters: hold an id across a write and it silently addresses another date.
