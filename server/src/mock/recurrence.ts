/**
 * Enough recurrence expansion for the mock to behave like Stalwart 0.16.21.
 *
 * The mock used to hand a recurring event back once, as its stored self. Three
 * things that only a live server showed were therefore impossible to develop
 * against, and all three had already cost a debugging session:
 *
 * - an expanded query gives *everything* a synthetic id over a `baseEventId`,
 *   a one-off included, so `baseEventId` is no evidence of a series;
 * - an occurrence carries a `recurrenceId` and no rule of its own;
 * - a write aimed at a synthetic id becomes a `recurrenceOverrides` entry
 *   rather than touching the series.
 *
 * A mock that agrees with the client rather than with the server is how #26 and
 * #30 reached a live instance, so the refusals matter as much as the successes:
 * what Stalwart rejects is rejected here, and what it drops in silence is
 * dropped here, in silence, on purpose.

 *
 * **They are stable, and that is a change.** Up to 0.16.20 a synthetic id
 * encoded a *position* in the expanded series, so writing one override
 * renumbered the rest and a held id silently began addressing a different
 * date — a hazard this file used to reproduce on purpose. 0.16.21 fixed it:
 * an occurrence is now identified by its recurrence id.
 *
 * **Confirmed live on 0.16.21 (2026-09-06):** a five-week weekly series was
 * expanded, the third occurrence retitled through its synthetic id, and all
 * five original ids re-read afterwards. Every one still resolved, and every
 * one still named its own date; nothing was renumbered and nothing was
 * `notFound`. Only the *order* of the ids from an expanded query changed —
 * the overridden occurrence moved to the end of the list — which is why a
 * client sorts by `start` rather than trusting query order.
 *
 * The real ids look nothing like these (`h1fo9uaaaaab` for the first of that
 * series); what has to match is that holding one across a write stays correct.
