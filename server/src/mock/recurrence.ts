/**
 * Enough recurrence expansion for the mock to behave like Stalwart 0.16.22.
 *
 * A recurring event handed back once, as its stored self, hides three things
 * that only a live server shows -- each of them a debugging session against a
 * live instance:
 *
 * - an expanded query gives *everything* a synthetic id over a `baseEventId`,
 *   a one-off included, so `baseEventId` is no evidence of a series;
 * - an occurrence carries a `recurrenceId` and no rule of its own;
 * - a write aimed at a synthetic id becomes a `recurrenceOverrides` entry
 *   rather than touching the series.
 *
 * A mock that agrees with the client rather than with the server is how #26 and
 * #30 reached a live instance, so the refusals matter as much as the successes:
 * what Stalwart rejects is rejected here, and what it drops in silence is
 * dropped here, in silence, on purpose.

 * them, and nothing in Gilbert may read either.
 *
 * **They are stable.** An id that encoded a *position* in the expanded series
 * would be renumbered by a write to one override, and a held id would silently
 * begin addressing a different date. 0.16.21 identifies an occurrence by its
 * recurrence id, which is what this file reproduces.
 *
 * **Confirmed live on 0.16.21 (2026-09-06):** a five-week weekly series was
 * expanded, the third occurrence retitled through its synthetic id, and all
 * five original ids re-read afterwards. Every one still resolved, and every
 * one still named its own date; nothing was renumbered and nothing was
 * `notFound`. Only the *order* of the ids from an expanded query changed —
 * the overridden occurrence moved to the end of the list — which is why a
 * client sorts by `start` rather than trusting query order.
 *
 * The real ids look nothing like these (`h1fo9uaaaaab` for the first of that
 * series); what has to match is that holding one across a write stays correct.
