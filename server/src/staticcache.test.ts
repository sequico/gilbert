 * What may be served stale, and what may not.
 *
 * This is not a preference about freshness. The service worker is the app's
 * whole update mechanism: a browser holding an old one goes on being served
 * the shell that worker knows and never finds out a deploy happened. On
 * 2026-09-08 the origin had the new build while Cloudflare handed out the
 * previous `sw.js` for hours, because it was neither a hashed asset nor HTML
 * and so went out with an hour's max-age that the CDN then extended.
 *
 * A static root of our own, since CI runs the tests before the build and
 * `web/dist` does not exist yet.
