/**
 * Fetching a calendar somebody has subscribed to.
 *
 * The browser cannot do this itself: a calendar URL belongs to whoever
 * published it and almost none of them send CORS headers, so the request has
 * to be made from here. That makes it the second place Gilbert reaches out to
 * an address a stranger chose, and it goes through exactly the same guard as
 * the first — `safeFetch` resolves the name, refuses private space on every
 * answer, pins the connection to the address it checked, and re-checks each
 * redirect. There is deliberately no second implementation of that.
 *
 * **Nothing is stored.** The text goes straight back to the browser, which
 * parses it and holds the result in memory for as long as the tab is open. The
 * server keeps no copy, no cache and no schedule, which is what lets an
 * immutable container serve this at all.
